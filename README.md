### Introduction:

This project aims to develop AI-powered agents to assist in managing litigation cases from inception to completion, drawing inspiration from software project development methodologies. Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the goal is to aid legal professionals in tasks such as case management, legal research, document analysis, and case strategy formulation. The project will involve data collection and preparation, selection of appropriate AI technologies, and model development tailored to the specific needs of litigation cases.

I have a solid background in litigation (20 years) and have completed a MERN stack bootcamp.  Learning AI agent development is very much a new thing for me, so this repository is kind of like a project notebook.  I am working with OpenAI ChatGPT (3.5/4.0) to develop a project roadmap, identify learning gaps, and to learn/build the AI Agents.
